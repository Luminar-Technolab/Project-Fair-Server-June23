        MongoDB : Used to store large amount of data permanently
    ---------------

    1. Difference between SQL and MongoDB
                SQL                                 MongoDB
        -------------------------          ----------------------------
        - Relational DBMS                   - Document Oriented NoSQL DB
        - store in Table with row &         - Collection of JSON Documents
          columns
        - uses fixed schema                 - use dynamic schema
        - used to optimise complex join     - optimised for scalability and
          and transaction                     performance
        - support rich set of data types    - limited set of data types
        - Declarative query languauge       - Expressive query languauge based
                                              on JSON
        - ACID (Atomicity, consistancy,     - NoSQL based on CAP (Consistancy , 
          Isolation and Durability)           Availability and Partition tolerance)
          property                            property
        - uses Traditional bussiness        - used in big data and real time web
          application                         application
    2. Commands in MongoDB - CRUD
      - show databases : display all dbs
      - use db-name : redirect to a particular db
      - show collections : display all collections
      - find() : to get all Documents from a collection
      - find(condition) : to get all Documents which statisfy the condition from a collection
      - findOne(condition) : get only single Document which statisfy the condition else return null
      - limit(count) : to limit Document while reading from db
      - sort() : to sort Documents based on any key
      - countDocuments() : to get total number of documents in a collection
      - insertMany(array of documents) : insert more document at the same time
      - inserOne(): insert single document at a time
      - updateMany() : update more document at the same time
      - updateOne: update a single document
      - deleteOne: delete a single document
      - deleteMany(): delete more document at the same time
      - Quering Commands
        - $gt / gte / lt / lte
        - $and / $or
        - $eq / $ne
        - $in / $nin
        - $exists
        - $set
        - $push
        - $pull
      - Aggregation: Aggregation operations process multiple documents and return computed results
        - $lookup : syntax
          collection.aggregate({$lookup:
            {
              from: <collection to join>,
              localField: <field from the input documents>,
              foreignField: <field from the documents of the "from" collection>,
              as: <output array field>
            }
        })
    3. Mongoose : MongoDB ODM (Object database Modelling)
      - used to translate the code and its representation from MongoDB to the Node.js 
      - Advantages of Mongoose module:
        - Collection validation of the MongoDB database can be done easily.
        - Predefined Structure can be implemented on the collection.
        - Constraints can be applied to documents of collections using Mongoose.
